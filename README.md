# Guess-the-Anime

Notes for the application:
 - Guess the anime given
 - Blurred Anime image, maybe given 4 choices
 - Anime is taken from an API
 - No use of JQuery
 - Spring JPA instead of JDBC
 - Add security and encryption of password (Hashes and Salts)

 - Have a record, which is saved in the database, and that is how many you got in a row

Current fixes:
 - front-end design
 - make secure for https
 - error handling in backend
 - show error on input in frontend
