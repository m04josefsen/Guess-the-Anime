- **CSS:** Defines the styles and layout of the website.
- **JavaScript:** Implements the game logic and interactivity.
- **Bootstrap:** Used for styling and layout components.

### Backend:
- **Java:** Backend logic is implemented using Java.
- **Spring Boot:** Provides a framework for building robust and scalable web applications.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API):** Used for object-relational mapping and accessing the database.
- **BCrypt:** Used for hashing passwords for secure storage.

### Database:
